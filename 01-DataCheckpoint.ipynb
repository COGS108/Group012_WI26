    "The United States has long been derided for its poor implementation of public transit infrastructure and poor urban planning centered around private vehicle travel. Proponents of U.S. public transit have argued that investment in automobile infrastructure in the 20th century pushed the United States away from effective transit systems.1 As a consequence of this early investment, the United States faces significantly worse public transit systems than other modernized nations do. Dependency on private vehicles for urban transportation would suggest that U.S. consumers have relatively inelastic responses to changes in gas prices. In light of this, our analysis aims to find whether gas prices can be used as a predictor of public transit ridership in the United States, and if it can, to what extent ridership can be predicted in each state based on changes in gas prices year over year.\n",
    "\n",
    "The relationship between gas prices and rise in public transit ridership is well documented, with many studies within the past two decades reporting a positive association between the two variables worldwide. This can be seen in the studies by Chao et al.2 and Alves et al.3, who looked at ridership responses to gas prices in Taiwan and in the European Union (EU). Chao finds that gasoline prices have a “significantly positive” relationship on bus and transit use in Taiwan, with use increasing more than it decreases as gasoline prices rise and fall respectively. Chao’s findings are not unexpected and build on existing literature on the subject; from a study in 1978 by Agthe & Billings up to a study in 2014 by Fujisaki, many other studies have reported a similar relationship. In an even more recent study, Alves looks at the change in public transportation use in the EU in the wake of the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, which led to spikes in oil prices as a result of various trade restrictions that emerged from the conflict. Alves findings reveal a strong correlation on a week by week basis between price and ridership, particularly in countries in the EU where motorization was already prevalent. These studies reveal that there is a consistent, positive correlative pattern between fuel prices and public transit ridership internationally.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar studies have been conducted on the United States as well. Blanchard, in a study in 2009, analyzed the extent of the increase of public transit demand in response to increasing gas prices at the time.4 Their own study finds significant variability in the results depending on the city, tending to vary somewhat depending on population, but more significantly with price as they rose over. Blanchard’s own review of the existing literature was inconclusive, with “the size and significance of gasoline prices’ effect on ridership” being indeterminate. While this is somewhat consistent with the international correlation of gasoline prices and public transit ridership, it does suggest that predicting ridership changes may be strongly multivariate and difficult to pin down based on gas prices alone. This perspective is mirrored in a study by Lane in 2010, who points out that contemporary research had looked at “the role of gas prices as one of many characteristics in predicting ridership.” 5 Changes to the energy and transportation sectors over time may mean that Blanchard’s work is not entirely representative of modern day transportation preferences and developments.\n",
    "\n",
    "As gas prices rise, it’s important to understand how demand for transportation will change in response. This data analysis aims to build on the existing literature to determine the extent to which public transportation demand correlates with changes to gas prices. The applications of the findings of this analysis are valuable for policy and urban planning, as managing transit load is vital for city operations in urban landscapes.\n",

    "We predict a positive correlation between average monthly U.S. gasoline prices and monthly public transit ridership in the United States. As gasoline prices increase, individuals may be more likely to use public transportation as a cost-saving alternative to driving. This is consistent with prior transportation research on fuel costs and travel behavior."

Normal values for healthy individuals range from 70 to 100 mg/dL.  Values 100-125 are prediabetic and values >125mg/dL indicate diabetes. Values <70 indicate hypoglycemia. Fasting idicates the patient hasn't eaten in the last 8 hours.  If blood glucose is >250 or <50 at any time (regardless of the time of last meal) the patient's life may be in immediate danger\"\n",
    "   2. If there are any major concerns with the dataset, describe them. For example \"Dataset is composed of people who are serious enough about eating healthy that they voluntarily downloaded an app dedicated to tracking their eating patterns. This sample is likely biased because of that self-selection. These people own smartphones and may be healthier and may have more disposable income than the average person.  Those who voluntarily log conscientiously and for long amounts of time are also likely even more interested in health than those who download the app and only log a bit before getting tired of it\"\n",

    "A. Data Collection\n",
    "A.1 Informed consent: If there are human subjects, have they given informed consent, where subjects affirmatively opt-in and have a clear understanding of the data uses to which they consent?\n",
    "This project uses publicly available, aggregated data on average gas prices and public transportation usage in the United States. No data is collected directly from individuals, and there are no human subjects involved in the data collection process. As a result, informed consent is not directly applicable to this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "A.2 Collection bias: Have we considered sources of bias that could be introduced during data collection and survey design and taken steps to mitigate those?\n",
    "We considered potential sources of collection bias in the datasets used. Public transportation usage may be overrepresented in urban areas and underrepresented in rural regions where transit options are limited. Additionally, gas prices vary significantly by region, which could influence the observed relationship. These factors are acknowledged when interpreting the results\n",
    "\n",
    "A.3 Limit PII exposure: Have we considered ways to minimize exposure of personally identifiable information (PII) for example through anonymization or not collecting information that isn't relevant for analysis?\n",
    "No personally identifiable information (PII) is collected or used in this project. All data is aggregated at a regional or national level, minimizing any risk of individual identification.\n",
    "\n",
    "A.4 Downstream bias mitigation: Have we considered ways to enable testing downstream results for biased outcomes (e.g., collecting data on protected group status like race or gender)?\n",
    "We acknowledge that the impacts of gas prices and public transportation usage may differ across demographic groups such as income level or geographic location. However, the datasets used do not include detailed demographic information. We note this limitation and avoid making claims about specific protected groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "B. Data Storage\n",
    "B.1 Data security: Do we have a plan to protect and secure data (e.g., encryption at rest and in transit, access controls on internal users and third parties, access logs, and up-to-date software)?\n",
    "B.2 Right to be forgotten: Do we have a mechanism through which an individual can request their personal information be removed?\n",
    "B.3 Data retention plan: Is there a schedule or plan to delete the data after it is no longer needed?\n",
    "C. Analysis\n",
    "C.1 Missing perspectives: Have we sought to address blindspots in the analysis through engagement with relevant stakeholders (e.g., checking assumptions and discussing implications with affected communities and subject matter experts)?\n",
    "We considered potential blind spots in the analysis, particularly the differences between urban and rural communities. Public transportation availability and usage can vary widely depending on infrastructure, population density, and regional policy, which may not be fully captured in the datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "C.2 Dataset bias: Have we examined the data for possible sources of bias and taken steps to mitigate or address these biases (e.g., stereotype perpetuation, confirmation bias, imbalanced classes, or omitted confounding variables)?\n",
    "The datasets may contain biases due to uneven reporting across regions or time periods. Additionally, public transportation usage data may not capture informal or alternative transportation methods. These limitations are acknowledged in the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "C.3 Honest representation: Are our visualizations, summary statistics, and reports designed to honestly represent the underlying data?\n",
    "All visualizations and summary statistics are designed to accurately reflect the underlying data. Care is taken to avoid misleading representations, and correlation results are not interpreted as evidence of causation.\n",
    "\n",
    "C.4 Privacy in analysis: Have we ensured that data with PII are not used or displayed unless necessary for the analysis?\n",
    "No data containing PII is used or displayed in the analysis. All results are reported in aggregated form.\n",
    "\n",
    "C.5 Auditability: Is the process of generating the analysis well documented and reproducible if we discover issues in the future?\n",
    "The data sources, preprocessing steps, and analysis methods are documented to ensure that the analysis is reproducible and can be reviewed in the future if issues are identified.e\n",
    "\n",
    "D. Modeling\n",
    "D.1 Proxy discrimination: Have we ensured that the model does not rely on variables or proxies for variables that are unfairly discriminatory?\n",
    "D.2 Fairness across groups: Have we tested model results for fairness with respect to different affected groups (e.g., tested for disparate error rates)?\n",
    "D.3 Metric selection: Have we considered the effects of optimizing for our defined metrics and considered additional metrics?\n",
    "D.4 Explainability: Can we explain in understandable terms a decision the model made in cases where a justification is needed?\n",
    "D.5 Communicate limitations: Have we communicated the shortcomings, limitations, and biases of the model to relevant stakeholders in ways that can be generally understood?\n",
    "E. Deployment\n",
    "E.1 Monitoring and evaluation: Do we have a clear plan to monitor the model and its impacts after it is deployed (e.g., performance monitoring, regular audit of sample predictions, human review of high-stakes decisions, reviewing downstream impacts of errors or low-confidence decisions, testing for concept drift)?\n",
    "E.2 Redress: Have we discussed with our organization a plan for response if users are harmed by the results (e.g., how does the data science team evaluate these cases and update analysis and models to prevent future harm)?\n",
    "E.3 Roll back: Is there a way to turn off or roll back the model in production if necessary?\n",
    "E.4 Unintended use: Have we taken steps to identify and prevent unintended uses and abuse of the model and do we have a plan to monitor these once the model is deployed?"
