    "The United States has long been derided for its poor implementation of public transit infrastructure and poor urban planning centered around private vehicle travel. Proponents of U.S. public transit have argued that investment in automobile infrastructure in the 20th century pushed the United States away from effective transit systems.<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1) As a consequence of this early investment, the United States faces significantly worse public transit systems than other modernized nations do. Dependency on private vehicles for urban transportation would suggest that U.S. consumers have relatively inelastic responses to changes in gas prices. In light of this, our analysis aims to find whether gas prices can be used as a predictor of public transit ridership in the United States, and if it can, to what extent ridership can be predicted in each state based on changes in gas prices year over year.\n",
    "\n",
    "The relationship between gas prices and rise in public transit ridership is well documented, with many studies within the past two decades reporting a positive association between the two variables worldwide. This can be seen in the studies by Chao et al.<a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2) and Alves et al.<a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite_note-3), who looked at ridership responses to gas prices in Taiwan and in the European Union (EU). Chao finds that gasoline prices have a “significantly positive” relationship on bus and transit use in Taiwan, with use increasing more than it decreases as gasoline prices rise and fall respectively. Chao’s findings are not unexpected and build on existing literature on the subject; from a study in 1978 by Agthe & Billings up to a study in 2014 by Fujisaki, many other studies have reported a similar relationship. In an even more recent study, Alves looks at the change in public transportation use in the EU in the wake of the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, which led to spikes in oil prices as a result of various trade restrictions that emerged from the conflict. Alves findings reveal a strong correlation on a week by week basis between price and ridership, particularly in countries in the EU where motorization was already prevalent. These studies reveal that there is a consistent, positive correlative pattern between fuel prices and public transit ridership internationally.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar studies have been conducted on the United States as well. Blanchard, in a study in 2009, analyzed the extent of the increase of public transit demand in response to increasing gas prices at the time.<a name=\"cite_ref-4\"></a>[<sup>4</sup>](#cite_note-4) Their own study finds significant variability in the results depending on the city, tending to vary somewhat depending on population, but more significantly with price as they rose over. Blanchard’s own review of the existing literature was inconclusive, with “the size and significance of gasoline prices’ effect on ridership” being indeterminate. While this is somewhat consistent with the international correlation of gasoline prices and public transit ridership, it does suggest that predicting ridership changes may be strongly multivariate and difficult to pin down based on gas prices alone. This perspective is mirrored in a study by Lane in 2010, who points out that contemporary research had looked at “the role of gas prices as one of many characteristics in predicting ridership.” <a name=\"cite_ref-5\"></a>[<sup>5</sup>](#cite_note-5) Changes to the energy and transportation sectors over time may mean that Blanchard’s work is not entirely representative of modern day transportation preferences and developments.\n",
    "\n",
    "As gas prices rise, it’s important to understand how demand for transportation will change in response. This data analysis aims to build on the existing literature to determine the extent to which public transportation demand correlates with changes to gas prices. The applications of the findings of this analysis are valuable for policy and urban planning, as managing transit load is vital for city operations in urban landscapes.\n",
